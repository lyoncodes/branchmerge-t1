# The Interview 
## *Part One...?*

I searched my closet for the perfect ( <ins> *article of clothing*</ins> ) to wear.
Dressing for the ( <ins> *Superlative*</ins> ) establishment around isn’t so simple, I must dress to impress.
Sweating ( <ins> *Plural Noun*</ins> ) during the interview is a sure sign of weakness. I try to calm my nerves by remembering to play up my strengths: ( <ins> *IT Field of study* </ins> ), menacing stares, and ( <ins> *Noun*</ins> ) collecting.

*Lord Vader*: “Welcome to the dark side. Your interview will ( <ins> *Verb*</ins> ) now.”

*Lord Vader*: “You’re hired. Wait, is that a ( <ins> *Article of Clothing*</ins> ) you’re wearing?”

Me: “No, it’s actually a ( <ins> *Adjective*</ins> ) suit.”

*Lord Vader*: “You’re fired. Maybe you should pursue a career in ( <ins>  *IT field of study*</ins> )..”
