# A MadLib Fairy Tale
Once upon a time there was a princess and she was really mean. She often would record her passwords as part of her morning ritual. Emily had an estranged-4th-cousin who was very tricky, in fact the most adept hacker in the entire Kingdom.

The Kingdom, and yes, the princess, was eager to hear from the land of the secure tokens. But They did not get along because the princess' encryption crashed. Finally, on the full syzergy Moon on a very clear night, The messenger Pablo was at the gate. The entire kingdom grimaced preparing for news. "Lo! You've all been breached! It was that tricky hacker Estranged-Fourth-Cousin who launched an error-based SQL injection on our front-end form! Have a nice life!"

Well, the kingdom wasn't having any of that malarky, and quickly mobilized their army of clowns to go after the estranged-fourth-cousin in his lair which was hidden in a dark place. The princess was really feeling mean now. She set a trap for the estranged-fourth-cousin using a salmon with a broken back. The princess was mean, but she had promised a reward of 3.2 jewels to whomever could capture the villanous Fourth-cousin.

That following day Pablo the agitated messenger had predictably woke up late, "not again" he thought. Right away Pablo fought out of his bed and opened on his terminal. Pablo always reads the server logs before he clocks in. Something interesting caught his eye, and this time it wasn't the marvelous speed of his response times. "BOUNTY: BIG $$$ CYBER CRIMINAL - Estranged-Fourth-Cousin of Ruler Princess" When Pablo stepped into his 8 x 8 cubicle in the high tower, his predictable, repetitive, non-linear, illogical boss was already there, tapping her smelly clogs. 
 
She told him if he was late one more time he was fired. If that wasnâ€™t bad enough, his boss was the princess. Pablo REALLY needed this gig, and he knew this was his last chance. He thought to himself.. "If I could just catch this hacker.. I would never have to work again!" He would spend the rest of his days lounging with the sailors. First, Pablo had to catch this hacker. He quiety sat in his swivel chair and kept his head down and began to think. He needed the reward all to himself. He had to do this one solo. "I want out" Pablo Said, and he had the most masterful plan...

While Pablo was busy planning, the princess was busy backing up her password files into different locations in the database. She was not about to leave her fate solely in the hands of a know-it-all techno geek like Pablo. He didn't even know how to use an alarm.  The princess went to the royal refrigerator and started devouring the pumpkin pies. If worse came to worse, the Russians would help her execute her plan.
